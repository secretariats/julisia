        <h1>Happy Birthday, Julisia!</h1>

        <div id="message">
          <p>I can't believe we're growing so old! I feel like time has really flown by since we first met all those years ago, and I'm really proud of basically everything you've done since. I may have forgotten all my Chinese and Analysis (okay, more like I never fully grasped the latter), but I still think back fondly to all our high school days when you'd listen to me go on about all my random, mildly embarassing interests. Out of my eight or so years of Chinese Sunday school, the only ones I can distinctly remember today are 1) being forced to give a humiliating presentation in front of the entire AP prep classroom, and 2) ditching class and sprawling onto the Gunn track until you got spooked by spiders. It's funny how Paly is kind of all a blur now, test after test and lunch after lunch in our frankly uncomfortable corner, but in hindsight everything is nicer when it's blurry anyway. Plus I hear Garden Club is still alive, although all they do is eat lunch together, so it's comforting to know some things never change!</p>

          <p>And you know, maybe it is easy to believe that you're already 21, because I feel like you've always been so much more composed and responsible than me, and it's cool to see you delving into new interests and somehow becoming even more poised in college! I know that someday you'll make a great doctor, if nothing else for your sheer patience and compassion, and I hope I'll still be around then to see you improving other people's lives as you have mine.</p>

          <p>Now that Century Theaters has those nice reclining seats, I've made it my duty to go as often as I can, and I expect you to come with me. So see you winter break, and until then, good luck with the rest of your quarter! Now go eat some cake or something.</p>

          <p>All the best,</p>
          <p style="font-size:19px">Cecile</p>

                  <p>Okay this isn't really a gift, sorry for the false advertisement, but you should listen to <b><a href="https://app.box.com/s/49hoqjitg5m3i4eubs0kkwo05dm3fg8z">1D's album</a></b>. I'm sure Justin Bieber's will be a lot better, but it's not out yet and this is probably One Direction's last album ever!!! Put it on your phone and listen to it while you go running or something!!

                  <p>Plus, have some puppies:</p>
